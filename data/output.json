      "excerpt": "WIDOCO helps you to publish and create an enriched and customized documentation of your ontology, by following a series of steps in a wizard. We extend the LODE framework by Silvio Peroni to describe the classes, properties and data properties of the ontology, the OOPS! webservice by María Poveda to print an evaluation and the Licensius service by Victor Rodriguez Doncel to determine the license URI and title being used. In addition, we use WebVowl to visualize the ontology and have extended Bubastis to show a complete changelog between different versions of your ontology. \nFeatures of WIDOCO: \n* Automatic documentation of the terms in your ontology (based on LODE) \n* Automatic annotation in JSON-LD snippets of the html produced. \n* Association of a provenance page which includes the history of your vocabulary (W3C PROV-O compliant). \n* Metadata extraction from the ontology plus the means to complete it on the fly when generating your ontology. Check the best practice document to know more about the terms recognized by WIDOCO. \n* Guidelines on the main sections that your document should have and how to complete them. \n* Integration with diagram creators (WebVOWL). \n* Automatic changelog of differences between the actual and the previous version of the ontology (based on Bubastis). \n* Separation of the sections of your html page so you can write them independently and replace only those needed. \n* Content negotiation and serialization of your ontology according to W3C best practices \n",

Then just double click the .jar file. \nNow you can execute WIDOCO through the console. Usage: \njava -jar widoco-VERSION-jar-with-dependencies.jar [-ontFile file] or [-ontURI uri] [-outFolder folderName] [-confFile propertiesFile] or [-getOntologyMetadata] [-oops] [-rewriteAll] [-crossRef] [-saveConfig configOutFile] [-useCustomStyle] [-lang lang1-lang2] [-includeImportedOntologies] [-htaccess] [-webVowl] [-licensius] [-ignoreIndividuals] [-analytics analyticsCode] [-doNotDisplaySerializations][-displayDirectImportsOnly] [-rewriteBase rewriteBasePath] [-excludeIntroduction] [-uniteSections] \nThe ontFile and ontURI options allow you to choose the ontology file or ontology URI of your ontology. \nThe -outFolder option specifies where you want to place the output. \nThe -confFile allows you to choose your own configuration file for the ontology metadata. However you can tell WIDOCO to try to extract some of the metadata from the ontology with getOntologyMetadata. \nThe -oops flag creates an html page with the evaluation from the OOPS service (http://oops.linkeddata.es/) \nThe -rewriteAll option will tell WIDOCO to rewrite files if the new generate files are replacing existing files. Otherwise the tool will promt a window asking the user. \nThe -crossRef option will ONLY generate the overview and cross reference sections. The index document will NOT be generated. The htaccess, provenance page, etc., will not be generated unless requested by other flags. This flag in intended to be used only after a first version of the documentation exists. \nThe -saveConfig option allows you to save a configuration file on the \"configOutFile\" route with the properties of a given ontology. \nThe -useCustomStyle option allows exporting the documentation using alternate css files (thanks to Daniel Vila). \nThe -lang option allows showing the languages in which the documentation will be published (separated by \"-\"). Note that if the language is not supported, the system will load the labels in english. For example: en-pt-es \nThe -includeImportedOntologies flag indicates whether the terms of the imported ontologies of the current ontology should be documented as well or not. \nThe -htaccess flag creates a bundle for publication ready to be deployed on your apache server. \nThe -webVowl flag provides a link to a visualization based on WebVowl (http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/webvowl/index.html#). \nThe -licensius flag uses the Licensius web services (http://licensius.com/apidoc/index.html) to retrieve license metadata. Only works if the -getOntologyMetadata flag is enabled. \nThe -ignoreIndividuals flag allows you to ignore the named individuals in the ontology. \nThe -includeAnnotationProperties flag will include annotation properties defined in your ontology (by default they are not included) \nThe -analytics flag will add a code snippet for Google analytics to track your page. You need to add your code next to it. For example: UA-1234 \nThe -doNotDisplaySerializations flag allows not displaying available serializations of the ontology. \nThe -displayDirectImportsOnly flag allows displaying only those imported ontologies that are directly imported in the ontology being documented. \nThe -rewriteBase flag allows changing the default rewrite base path (until the documentation folder). By default it is \"/\". \nThe -excludeIntroduction flag skips adding an introduction section. \nThe -uniteSections includes all sections in the same HTML document. \n",

This is a key-value pair file with metadata properties. Some people consider it easier than adding the property annotations to the OWL file, although I recommend doing the former option.

Before, an empty section would remain.\r\n* Fixed table of contents not being translated.\r\n* When generating the documentation of an ontology, if it imports another ontology that cannot be imported for any reason, Widoco will ignore the import instead of failing.\r\n* Added the possibility to ignore namedIndividuals when generating the documentation through console.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "This version of Widoco creates an automated changelog section of your ontology. For all classes, properties and data properties, Widoco will calculate the new changes, additions and deletions and present them in a human-readable manner. In order to benefit from this feature, you just have to annotate your ontology with the URI of the previous version. You can use owl:priorVersion, dc:replaces or prov:wasRevisionOf to annotate your ontology (Widoco will only consider one file to compare against).\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements:\r\n* RDF-a annotations are replaced with JSON-LD snippets. The page is just annotated with schema.org. The rdf-a annotations made it difficult to maintain, and the structured extraction tool provided by Google did not work. With the JSON-LD snippet everything is clearer. The provenance of the page itself is published separately.\r\n* Now it is possible to generate ONLY the cross reference section of an ontology.\r\n* Bug fix that led to errors when opening some ontologies like OBI\r\n\r\nOverview sample of the changelog:\r\n![overview](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1520666/23640611/ac4407f6-02a3-11e7-8a88-b597ba740721.png)\r\n",
